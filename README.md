# Autonomous Vehicle Survey of Pittsburghâ€™s Pedestrians and Bicyclists

## Overview

This project examines how pedestrians and cyclists in Pittsburgh perceive autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study analyzes survey data to assess public trust, safety concerns, and infrastructure needs, providing valuable insights into how AV technology can be integrated into urban environments.

## Key Features

- **Survey-Based Analysis**: Investigates perceptions of AV safety and comfort among pedestrians and cyclists.
- **Data Processing & Visualization**: Uses Python and R for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modeling.
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling**: Predicts safety perceptions based on demographic and contextual factors.
- **AWS Cloud Implementation**: Leverages AWS S3, Glue, and Athena for data storage and SQL-based querying.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, AWS Glue
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Caret (R)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS S3, AWS Athena, AWS Glue

## Data Insights

- Pedestrians and cyclists feel safer with dedicated AV infrastructure.
- Younger participants and tech-savvy individuals have higher trust in AVs.
- Lack of human-like signals and quiet AV operation raise safety concerns.
